# Expense Tracker Project Brief

## Overview

A web application for tracking shared expenses between partners. The application allows entering monthly expenses with details about who paid and how the expense is split.

## Core Requirements

- Track expenses with description, date, amount, and payment source
- Support different expense splitting scenarios (50/50, custom percentages, one person owes full amount)
- Track currency (USD default, with support for CAD)
- Restrict access to only authorized users (the couple)
- Deploy to Azure using free tier resources

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to enter an expense with basic details so I can track our spending
2. As a user, I want to specify who paid for an expense so we can track individual contributions
3. As a user, I want to define how an expense is split so we can accurately track who owes what
4. As a user, I want to see a balance summary so I know who owes money to whom
5. As a user, I want to access the application securely so our financial data remains private

## Future Considerations

- Additional expense fields and categories
- Tracking when debts are settled
- Currency conversion for reports
- Recurring expenses
